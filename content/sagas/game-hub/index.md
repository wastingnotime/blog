This saga explores the creation of a **Game Hub** — a platform designed to host multiple simple games under one structure.

It starts from nothing but an idea:
> “Can we turn learning architecture into play?”

Through this saga we’ll:
- Design the foundation of a multiplayer-ready game hub.
- Experiment with Go, APIs, and lightweight cloud components.
- Treat each iteration as a story — from prototype to principle.

In *WastingNoTime*, the Game Hub acts as a living metaphor for system design: each game is a service, each duel a message, and each player a request looking for response.
