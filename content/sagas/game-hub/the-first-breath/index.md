Every creation starts with a breath.  
In this first arc, the **Game Hub** awakens — from concept to code.

We define what *WastingNoTime* stands for: learning through building, embracing mistakes, and turning each idea into a working prototype.

The first experiment? **Trivia Duel** — a small competitive game used to give the hub its pulse.  
This arc documents the first steps of the system’s life: from intention to implementation.
