**HireFlow** is a hands-on laboratory where we build a hiring platform from scratch using a microservices approach.  
Not to follow the hype—but to understand how these systems behave when reality hits:

- when the database goes down
- when messages arrive out of order
- when teams disagree
- when refactoring is necessary
- when complexity emerges naturally

Every arc explores a different facet of architecture: boundaries, data ownership, slicing strategies, refactoring, resilience, and the design forces that shape distributed systems.

This saga embraces an idea that guides the whole studio:  
**a system reveals its truth only when we build it.**

Let’s build HireFlow together—and learn from its evolution.
