# The Origin Blueprint

Every system begins with a question: *why does this exist?*  
Before we draw boundaries or pick technologies, we define meaning, drivers, and intention.

This arc explores:

- the need for a microservices playground
- the idea of emergent architecture
- the functional goals of HireFlow
- the first conceptual boundaries
- how decisions evolve before a single line of code is written

This is the architectural deep breath before the first cut.
