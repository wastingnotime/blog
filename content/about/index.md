# wasting no time

Parallel sagas evolving at their own pace.

I'm **Henrique Riccio**, a software engineer and architect who enjoys designing systems that age well.

**Wasting No Time** is a personal studio — part reflection, part laboratory.  
It’s where I document the process of building things that matter, and the ideas that appear between builds.

Here you’ll find:

* **Sagas** — long-term projects like the Medical Appointment System or the Smart Recommender, written as arcs and episodes.
* **Posts** — independent essays on performance, focus, and professional growth.
* **Library** — a living index of what I’ve learned along the way.

The name isn’t about rushing.  
It’s about intention — using time with purpose.
