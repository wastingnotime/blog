The story behind <span class="text-zinc-100">wasting no time</span>

{{ define "intro" }}
Parallel sagas evolving at their own pace. I'm Henrique Riccio, a software engineer and architect who enjoys designing systems that age well. <strong>wasting no time</strong> is where I build in public, write honestly about the work, and document what it costs to do things with intention.

            <p class="text-sm text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">

            <p class="text-sm text-zinc-400 leading-relaxed mb-4">
                The name isn’t about rushing — it’s about intention. Using time with purpose instead of letting others spend it for you.
